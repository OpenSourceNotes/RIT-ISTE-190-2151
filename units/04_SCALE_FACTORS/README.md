## Orders of magnitude
* Estimate of relative size or magnitude expressed as a power of ten
* Even a single order of magnitude can result in significant change in world
* Except in case of 0.5, orders of magnitude represented as whole integers
* *Example*: Transportation
| Horse and Buggy | Automobile                                                 | Commercial airliner                                                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6 mph           | 60 mph                                                     | 600 mph                                                                 |
| -               | 1 order of magnitude faster than buggy; (60/6) = 10 = 10^1 | 1 order of magnitude faster than automobile; (600/60) = 10 = 10^1       |
| -               | -                                                          | 2 orders of magnitude faster than horse and buggy; (600/6) = 100 = 10^2 |
