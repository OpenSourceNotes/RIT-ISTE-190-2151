ISTE-190 - Course Themes Overview
=================================

## 21st Century Computing
* Exciting times in world of IST
* New form factors becomning available in mobile tech
* High-capacity cloud computing systems providing massive power
* Massive data collection
* Human Internet users increasing
* Non-human Internet users rapidly increasing

## Connectivity
* IT-enable game changer
* What is being connected?
 * People to people
 * People to information
 * Information to information (e.g. hyperlinks)
 * Systems to systems
 * **Things to systems**
 * **Things to things**
* Things = sensors, physical objects

## Internet of Things
* Allows for creative solutions to complex problems
* Easier to collect data and make solutions
* Goals
 * Improve convenience, peace of mind, safety
 * Support more efficient and effective use of resources
 * Data analytics, data mining, big data

## Ubiquitous computing (ubiq)
* Enabled by constant connectivity (see mobile tech)
 * Computing anywhere, any time
  * Any device in any form factor (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.)
  * Any place (home, school, work, train, bus, automobile, TV, etc.)
 * Data and information everywhere (home, work, school, cloud)
  * Embedded in environment (GPS)
 * Natural interfaces (voice, gesture, eye blink)

## Mobile
* Another game changer
* Smartphones, tablets, wearables
* Computing any time, anywhere, all the time
* Billions walking around with apps

## Computing at scale
* *Scale* used to talk about relative number of things being processed
 * *Small scale*: Small number of things being processed
 * *Large scale*: Also goes to ultra-large scale; large number of things being processed
* Examples
 * U.S. credit card transactions (55 million/day)
 * Twitter tweets (400 million daily by humans)
 * Google searches (3 billion and more daily)

### Infrastructure at scale
* Extension to computing at scale
* *Infrastructure* means aggregate of compute power / storage capacity / network capacity
* To support computing at scale, infrastructure at scale needed to support it

## Disruption
* Another game changer
* Disruptive technology changes status quo
* *Disruptive technology* used in context of industry changing way of doing business and/or introducing a new technology and/or use of existing technology
* Examples in the smartphone industry
 * Low- to mid-range digital camera industry destroyed
 * Dedicated navigation device industry (e.g. Garmin)
 * Impacting taxi cab industry (Uber)
